/**
 * ABUNDANT NUMBER
 * 
 * A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is
 * exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of
 * 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.
 * 
 * A number n is called abundant if the sum of its proper divisors is great than n
